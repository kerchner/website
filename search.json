    "text": "Basic conditional display\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUse the show_if argument to control basic conditional display logic.\n\n\nIt is often useful to have a question display conditionally based on the value of another question. For example, let’s say we have a multiple choice question about people’s favorite penguin type, and the last option is “other”. If the respondent chose it, you may want a second question to popup that allows them to specify the other penguin type, like this:\n\n\n\n\nTo implement this, you first need to define both the triggering question and the target question, like this:\n\nsd_question(\n  type  = 'mc',\n  id    = 'penguins',\n  label = \"Which is your favorite type of penguin?\",\n  option = c(\n    'Adélie'    = 'adelie',\n    'Chinstrap' = 'chinstrap',\n    'Gentoo'    = 'gentoo',\n    'Other'     = 'other'\n  )\n)\n\nsd_question(\n  type  = \"text\",\n  id    = \"penguins_other\",\n  label = \"Please specify the other penguin type:\"\n)\n\nThen in the server code chunk, you can use the show_if argument to define that the penguins_other question would only be shown if the respondent chose the other option in the penguins question, like this:\n\nconfig &lt;- sd_config(\n  show_if = tibble::tribble(\n    ~question_id,  ~question_value, ~target,\n    \"penguins\",    \"other\",         \"penguins_other\"\n  )\n)\n\nHere we’re using the tibble::tribble() function (which is like data.frame() but easier to read), to define a data frame with three columns:\n\nquestion_id: The id of the triggering question.\nquestion_value: The triggering value.\ntarget: The id of the target question to display.\n\nEach row in the data frame defines a condition.\nYou don’t have to use tibble::tribble(), and in fact if you have a lot of show_if conditions, then you could create a csv file with all of your conditions in it and read it in to set the show_if conditions (just make sure the header has the same three column names), e.g.:\n\nconfig &lt;- sd_config(\n  show_if = readr::read_csv('path/to/show_if_conditions.csv')\n  )\n)",

    "text": "Custom conditional display\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUse the show_if_custom argument to control custom conditional display logic.\n\n\nThe standard show_if argument is great for simple conditional display logic, but sometimes you need more flexibility. For example, you may want to display a question based on the values of two different questions. In this case, you can use the show_if_custom argument to define a custom function that determines the conditions for displaying a target question.\nUsing the same example as above, let’s say we only want to display the penguins_other question if the respondent chose the other option in the penguins question and also if they chose show in a second question, show_other:\n\nsd_question(\n  type  = 'mc',\n  id    = 'show_other',\n  label = \"Should we show the 'other' option question?\",\n  option = c(\n    'Show' = 'show',\n    'Hide' = 'hide'\n  )\n)\n\nNow we can define a custom function that will check the values of the penguins and show_other questions and return a logical value indicating whether both conditions are met. Then we can use this function in the show_if_custom argument:\n\nshow_other &lt;- function(input) {\n  return(input$penguins == \"other\" & input$show_other == \"show\")\n}\n\nconfig &lt;- sd_config(\n  show_if_custom = list(\n    list(condition = show_other, target = \"penguins_other\")\n  )\n)\n\nHere we provided the show_if_custom argument a list of lists, where each sublist contains a condition and a target. In this example, we just have one condition (the show_other function, which if true will display the penguins_other question), but you can add as many conditions as you want.\nIf lists of lists are a little confusing, you can also use a tibble::tribble() to define the conditions, like this:\n\nconfig &lt;- sd_config(\n  show_if_custom = tibble::tribble(\n    ~condition, ~target,\n    show_other, \"penguins_other\"\n  )\n)\n\nIn this case, each row in the tibble() is a condition with each condition in the condition column and the target question to display in the target column.

To do this, you would first define a question about their vehicle ownership, e.g.:\n\nsd_question(\n  type  = 'mc',\n  id    = 'vehicle_ownership',\n  label = \"Do you own your vehicle?\",\n  option = c(\n    'Yes' = 'yes',\n    'No'  = 'no'\n  )\n)\n\nThen in the server code chunk, you can use the skip_if argument in sd_config() to define the behavior of the next button on the page where you ask this question, like this:\n\nconfig &lt;- sd_config(\n  skip_if = tibble::tribble(\n    ~question_id,        ~question_value, ~target,\n    \"vehicle_ownership\", \"no\",            \"screenout\"\n  )\n)\n\nThis sets up a condition where the respondent will be sent to a page named screenout if they choose no on the vehicle_ownership question. Notice that again we used tibble::tribble() to define the conditions, just as we did for the show_if argument in basic conditional display, but again you could use a csv file if you have a lot of conditions.\nIn this example, you could make a screenout page and put it anywhere in your survey after the vehicle_ownership question, something like this:\n\n::: {#screenout .sd-page}\n\nSorry, but you are not qualified to take our survey.\n\n:::\n\nNotice that we don’t have a sd_next() on this screenout page - that is how you define an end point for the survey taker. If there’s no “Next” button, then they cannot navigate anywhere else, so the survey is over. This is why this screenout page doesn’t necessarily have to be at the end of the survey as the respondent will not be able to navigate anywhere else once reaching this page.",

    "text": "Custom skipping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUse the skip_if_custom argument to control custom skipping logic.\n\n\nSimilar to the show_if_custom argument, the skip_if_custom argument allows you to define custom skipping logic. This is useful if you need to skip a question based on the values of two or more different questions (or other conditions).\nFor example, let’s say you want to screen out respondents only if they choose no on the vehicle_ownership question and no on a second question, vehicle_buyer:\n\nsd_question(\n  type  = 'mc',\n  id    = 'vehicle_buyer',\n  label = \"Are you looking to buy a vehicle soon?\",\n  option = c(\n    'Yes' = 'yes',\n    'No'  = 'no'\n  )\n)\n\nTo implement this, we can define a custom function that will check the values of the vehicle_ownership and vehicle_buyer questions and return a logical value indicating whether both conditions are met. Then we can use this function in the skip_if_custom argument:\n\nscreenout &lt;- function(input) {\n  return(input$vehicle_ownership == \"no\" & input$vehicle_buyer == \"no\")\n}\n\nconfig &lt;- sd_config(\n  skip_if_custom = list(\n    list(condition = screenout, target = \"screenout\")\n  )\n)\n\nJust as with the show_if_custom argument, we provide the skip_if_custom argument a list of lists, where each sublist contains a condition and a target.\nIf lists of lists are a little confusing, you can also use a tibble::tribble() to define the conditions, like this:\n\nconfig &lt;- sd_config(\n  skip_if_custom = tibble::tribble(\n    ~condition, ~target,\n    screenout, \"screenout\"\n  )\n)\n\nIn this case, each row in the tibble() is a condition with each condition in the condition column and the target question to display in the target column. This layout is sometimes a little easier to read, especially if you have a lot of conditions.",

This password will then be defined in your survey project. In the very end of your survey .qmd file, you’ll need to define the db variable, which should be the settings of your supabase project. There is an argument called password. You can directly paste your password here as password = \"my_password\", but it’s not recommended since this will make your supabase project unsafe.\nWe recommend you to write password = Sys.getenv(\"SUPABASE_PASSWORD\"), like this:\n\ndb &lt;- sd_database(\n  # Other settings...\n  password = Sys.getenv(\"SUPABASE_PASSWORD\")\n)\n\nThen, define the password using the sd_set_password() function. For example, if your password is my_password, you should run sd_set_password(\"my_password\") in the R Console.\nGreat! Now you have your supabase password successfully defined in your survey project!\nIf you are interested, below are the details of what sd_set_password() does:\n\nIt creates an .Renviron file or writes into an existing one.\nIn this .Renviron file, it writes in SUPABASE_PASSWORD=my_password, where \"my_password\" is whatever your argument of the sd_set_password() function.\nIf there is a previously defined SUPABASE_PASSWORD in .Renviron, it will be overwritten, so you are safe to run this function multiple times.\nIt adds .Renviron into .gitignore to avoid it being pushed to GitHub thus keeps your password safe. If you run multiple times, .Renviron will appear only once in .gitignore.",

    "text": "Static Fetching\nOnce you have your database properly set up and your survey is live, you can fetch the data using the sd_get_data() function. All you have to do is pass in the db object you created with sd_database() to the sd_get_data() function.\nFor example, if you have a table called my_table in your Supabase database, you can fetch the data like this:\n\nlibrary(surveydown)\n\ndb &lt;- sd_database(\n  user   = 'postgres.axzkymswaxcasjdflkurrj',\n  host   = 'aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com',\n  port   = 5678,\n  db_name = 'postgres',\n  table_name = 'my_table'\n)\n\ndata &lt;- sd_get_data(db)\n\nHere the data object will be a data.frame with the data from your database.\n\n\nReactive Fetching\nThe above example is intended for an analysis context, where all you want to do is fetch the latest data from your database. However, you may also want to fetch the data in a reactive context (i.e. in your survey). For example, perhaps you want to show respondents a bar chart of the most common responses to a question. To enable this, all you have to do is set reactive = TRUE in the sd_get_data() function:\n\ndata &lt;- sd_get_data(db, reactive = TRUE)\n\nNow the data object will be a reactive expression, not a data.frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe reactive = TRUE feature must be used in the server code chunk of your survey. Placing this anywhere else (e.g. a code chunk in the main part of your survey) will result in an error.\n\n\nTo use it, you have to call it with () to get the latest data as a data.frame. For example:\n\ndata &lt;- sd_get_data(db, reactive = TRUE)\n\noutput$my_plot &lt;- renderPlot({  \n  my_data &lt;- data()\n  # insert code here to make a plot with my_data\n})\n\nHere the my_data object will be a data.frame with the latest data from your database, which you could then use to make a plot. In this example, the output$my_plot object will be a plot, which you can then display in your survey by placing plotOutput(\"my_plot\") in a code chunk (or inline code) somewhere in your survey.\nSee the Reactivity page for more information on how to use reactivity in your survey.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Overview\nsurveydown is a flexible, open-source platform for making surveys with , Quarto, shiny, and supabase. The accompanying  package is still in development, but you can already use it to create surveys!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe basic concept is this:\n\nDesign your survey as a Quarto shiny document using markdown and R code.\nRender your doc into a shiny app that can be hosted online and sent to respondents.\nStore your survey responses in a supabase database.\n\nWe recommend reading the Get Started page to get a sense of how to use surveydown. The rest of the documentation covers more details on how to use surveydown.\n\nGet Started!\n\n\n\nBackground & Motivation\nMost survey platforms (e.g., Google forms, Qualtrics, etc.) use drag-and-drop interfaces to design surveys, making version control and collaboration with others difficult. They’re also not reproducible (others cannot easily reproduce a survey made on these platforms), and many require a paid subscription or license to use.\nAs an open-source, markdown-based platform, surveydown was designed to address these problems. In surveydown, all survey content is created with plain text (markdown and R code) in a single .qmd file that renders into a shiny app. This makes your survey easy to reproduce, share, and version control with common tools like Git. The survey data collected is also owned by the survey designer in a supabase account. Best of all, everything is open source and free :)\nIf you’re curious where this whole idea came from, check out this blog post, which outlines more on the general idea and the motivation for it. The post is now outdated in terms of the overall package design, but it provides something of an origin story and some of the motivation for developing this project.\n\n\nEditing a surveydown survey\nEditing a surveydown survey feels like editing a Quarto document. As a result, we recommend working with an IDE to edit your surveys as they offer a better experience. RStudio is great, and we also like VS Code and Positron.\nOnce you have a survey ready to edit in your favorite IDE, you can render it locally to see how it will look as you change features. For example, the gif below shows what it looks like to make a question required. This gives you an idea for what the development process is like. And because surveydown leverages shiny and Quarto, you can add all sorts of custom features and styles to your survey!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Overview\nIn surveydown, surveys are designed using markdown and R code in a single Quarto document (a .qmd file). There is no GUI or drag-and-drop interface - simply write plain text (markdown & R code) and boom - you have a survey! 🎉\nThe {surveydown} R package provides a set of functions for defining the survey content and configuration options. Each function starts with sd_ to make them easy to identify.\nThe platform is based on some basic principles:\n\nAdd content to your survey using markdown text (or in RStudio use the visual editor).\nDefine survey questions in R code chunks with the sd_question() function.\nDefine pages using fences (:::), with navigation buttons handled using the sd_next() function.\nAdd rich functionality to your survey using configuration options in the server code chunk.\nStore your respondent data on supabase by setting the database settings in the server code chunk.\n\nThis approach ensures a flexible survey platform that is fully reproducible and easy to customize.\nThe remaining steps on this page will guide you through the process of creating a surveydown survey.\n\n\n1. Install\nSee installation.\n\n\n2. Start with a template\nIn the R console, run the following to to setup a template survey:\n\nsurveydown::sd_create_survey(\"path/to/folder\")\n\nThis will create a folder located at \"path/to/folder\" with the following files:\n\nexample.qmd: a template survey you should edit.\nexample.Rproj: An RStudio project file (helpful if you’re working in RStudio)\n_extensions: A folder with the surveydown Quarto extension needed to make everything work (don’t modify this).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nEvery survey created with {surveydown} should be in its own separate project folder.\n\n\n\n\n3. Add content\nSee the components page for details on the main components in a surveydown survey. For a quick overview, here’s how you add pages and questions:\n\nAdd pages with fences, like this:\n\n\n::: {#page1 .sd-page}\n\nPage 1 content here\n\n:::\n\n\nAdd questions with the sd_question() function in code chunks (see the Question Types page for more on the types of questions supported). For example, here’s a multiple choice question:\n\n\n```{r}\nsd_question(\n  type  = 'mc',\n  id    = 'penguins',\n  label = \"Which is your favorite type of penguin?\",\n  option = c(\n    'Adélie'    = 'adelie',\n    'Chinstrap' = 'chinstrap',\n    'Gentoo'    = 'gentoo'\n  )\n)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n\n\n\nWhich is your favorite type of penguin? *\n\n\n\n\n\nAdélie\n\n\n\n\n\nChinstrap\n\n\n\n\n\nGentoo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Add configuration options\nIn the server chunk (bottom of the .qmd file), add control logic and other configuration options to your survey with the sd_config() function. See the Configuration Options page for more details.\n\n\n5. Setup your database\nAlso in the server chunk, setup your database with the sd_database() function. You can also leave it blank to preview / edit your survey without database connected, or set pause = TRUE to disconnect the survey. See the Database Settings page for more details.\n\n\n6. Locally preview\nPreview your survey by clicking the “Run Document” button in RStudio or in your terminal running the command:\n\nquarto serve survey_file_name.qmd\n\nReplacing survey_file_name.qmd with the name of your survey .qmd file.\n\n\n7. Deploy\nDeploy your survey by hosting it on your favorite server, like shinyapps.io, huggingface, etc. See the Deployment page for more details.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

For example, let’s say you only wanted to only include people who own a vehicle.

    "section": "Reactivity",
    "text": "Reactivity\nOne other feature that is particularly powerful is the ability to use R code in your survey via Shiny’s reactive programming. This allows you to make your survey more interactive and to use the full power of R to create custom functionality.\n\nDemo 1: Displaying content based on previous responses\nLet’s say you wanted to create a survey that asked the respondent’s name, and then displayed a personalized message based on their name. You could do this by first asking their name:\n\nsd_question(\n  type  = \"text\",\n  id    = \"name\",\n  label = \"What is your name?\"\n)\n\nThen you can use the sd_display_value(\"name\") function to display the value of the name question in other parts of your survey. For example:\n\nWelcome, `r sd_display_value(\"name\")`!\n\nWhich would render as something like “Welcome, Dave!” (assuming the respondent entered “Dave” in the name question). This works because the sd_display_value() function is reactive, meaning it will update the display based on the respondent’s responses.\n\n\nDemo 2: Displaying randomized question labels\nLet’s say you wanted to show a series of questions, but you wanted to randomize the labels shown for each question. You could do this by first defining a list of labels, and then using the sd_question_reactive() function to create a question that will display a random label from the list.\nFor example, let’s ask the respondent to rate different car brands from a random set of brands. You could first pre-define the randomized sets of brands for each respondent and store it as a csv file, like this:\n\nbrands &lt;- c(\"Toyota\", \"Ford\", \"Chevrolet\", \"Honda\", \"Nissan\", \"Tesla\")\ndesign &lt;- data.frame(\n  respondent_id = rep(1:10, each = 3),\n  brand = unlist(lapply(1:10, function(x) sample(brands, 3, replace = FALSE)))\n)\nwrite_csv(design, \"design.csv\")\n\nThis would make a design file that looks like this:\n\n\n#&gt;   respondent_id     brand\n#&gt; 1             1      Ford\n#&gt; 2             1 Chevrolet\n#&gt; 3             1     Tesla\n#&gt; 4             2     Tesla\n#&gt; 5             2    Nissan\n#&gt; 6             2      Ford\n\n\nNote that this would not be done in your survey.qmd file - it’s just a one-time thing to create the design (probably stored in an R file).\nThen in your server code chunk, you could read in the design file and use it to randomize the labels for each question based on a randomly chosen respondent:\n\ndesign &lt;- read_csv(\"design.csv\")\nresp_id &lt;- sample(design$respondent_id, 1)\ndf_resp &lt;- design %&gt;% filter(respondent_id == resp_id)\n\noptions &lt;- c(1, 2, 3)\nnames(options) &lt;- df_resp$brand\n\nsd_question_reactive(\n  type  = \"mc\",\n  id    = \"brands\",\n  label = \"Which of these brands do you like best?\",\n  option = options\n)\n\nHere the sd_question_reactive() function is used because the labels depend on the randomly chosen respondent. This means the labels will be different for each respondent.\nSince this is a reactive question, this code must be placed inside the server code chunk, not where you want it to appear in the survey. To define where in the survey the question should appear, you use the sd_display_question() function with the id set to the same value as the id in the sd_question_reactive() function, like this:\n\nsd_display_question(id = \"brands\")\n\nNow the brands question will be displayed in the survey where you put this code chunk.\nNote that all question responses are automatically saved to the database, but if you wanted to store some other value (e.g. the randomly chosen respondent_id), you could do that with the sd_store_value() function, like this:\n\nsd_store_value(resp_id)"
