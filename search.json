For example, let’s say we have a multiple choice question about people’s favorite penguin type, and the last option is “other”. If the respondent chose it, you may want a second question to popup that allows them to specify the other penguin type. To implement this, you would need to first define both questions, e.g.:\n\nsd_question(\n  type  = 'mc',\n  id    = 'penguins',\n  label = \"Which is your favorite type of penguin?\",\n  option = c(\n    'Adélie'    = 'adelie',\n    'Chinstrap' = 'chinstrap',\n    'Gentoo'    = 'gentoo',\n    'Other'     = 'other'\n  )\n)\n\nsd_question(\n  type  = \"text\",\n  id    = \"penguins_other\",\n  label = \"Please specify the other penguin type:\"\n)\n\nThen in the server code chunk, you can use the show_if argument to define that the penguins_other question would only be shown if the respondent chose the other option in the penguins question, like this:\n\nconfig &lt;- sd_config(\n  show_if = tibble::tribble(\n    ~question_id,  ~question_value, ~target,\n    \"penguins\",    \"other\",         \"penguins_other\"\n  )\n)\n\nThis will make the penguins_other question only appear if the respondent chose the other option in the penguins question.\nHere we’re using the tibble::tribble() function to define a data frame with three columns:\n\nquestion_id: The id of the triggering question.\nquestion_value: The triggering value.\ntarget: The id of the target question to display.\n\nYou don’t have to use tibble::tribble(), and in fact if you have a lot of show_if conditions, then you could create a csv file with all of your conditions in it and read it in to set the show_if conditions (just make sure the header has the same three column names), e.g.:\n\nconfig &lt;- sd_config(\n  show_if = readr::read_csv('path/to/show_if_conditions.csv')\n  )\n)",

To do this, you would first define a question about their vehicle ownership, e.g.:\n\nsd_question(\n  type  = 'mc',\n  id    = 'vehicle_ownership',\n  label = \"Do you own your vehicle?\",\n  option = c(\n    'Yes' = 'yes',\n    'No'  = 'no'\n  )\n)\n\nThen in the server code chunk, you can use the skip_if argument in sd_config() to define the behavior of the next button on the page where you ask this question, like this:\n\nconfig &lt;- sd_config(\n  skip_if = tibble::tribble(\n    ~question_id,        ~question_value, ~target,\n    \"vehicle_ownership\", \"no\",            \"screenout\"\n  )\n)\n\nThis sets up a condition where the respondent will be sent to a page named screenout if they choose no on the vehicle_ownership question.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nIn surveydown, surveys are designed using markdown and R code in a single Quarto document (a .qmd file). There is no GUI or drag-and-drop interface - simply write plain text (markdown & R code) and boom - you have a survey! 🎉\nThe {surveydown} R package provides a set of functions for defining the survey content and configuration options. Each function starts with sd_ to make them easy to identify.\nThe platform is based on some basic principles:\n\nAdd content to your survey using markdown text (or in RStudio use the visual editor).\nDefine survey questions in R code chunks with the sd_question() function.\nDefine pages using fences (:::), with navigation buttons handled using the sd_next() function.\nAdd rich functionality to your survey in the server code chunk (the last code chunk at the bottom of the .qmd file), including complex configuration options with the sd_config() function, and the database settings with the sd_database() function.\n\nThis approach ensures a flexible survey platform that is fully reproducible and easy to customize.\nThe remaining steps on this page will guide you through the process of creating a surveydown survey.\n\n\n1. Install\nSee installation.\n\n\n2. Start with a template\nIn the R console, run the following to to setup a template survey:\n\nsurveydown::sd_create_survey(\"path/to/folder\")\n\nThis will create a folder located at \"path/to/folder\" with the following files:\n\nexample.qmd: a template survey you should edit.\nexample.Rproj: An RStudio project file (helpful if you’re working in RStudio)\n_extensions: A folder with the surveydown Quarto extension needed to make everything work (don’t modify this).\n\n\nEvery survey created with {surveydown} should be in its own separate project folder.\n\n\n\n3. Add content\nSee the components page for details on the main components in a surveydown survey, like. For a quick overview, here’s how you add pages and questions:\n\nAdd pages with fences, like this:\n\n\n::: {#page1 .sd-page}\n\nPage 1 content here\n\n:::\n\n\nAdd questions with the sd_question() function in code chunks (see the Question Types page for more on the types of questions supported). For example, here’s a multiple choice question:\n\n\n```{r}\nsd_question(\n  type  = 'mc',\n  id    = 'penguins',\n  label = \"Which is your favorite type of penguin?\",\n  option = c(\n    'Adélie'    = 'adelie',\n    'Chinstrap' = 'chinstrap',\n    'Gentoo'    = 'gentoo'\n  )\n)\n```\n\n\n\n4. Add configuration options\nIn the server chunk (bottom of the .qmd file), add control logic and other configuration options to your survey with the sd_config() function. See the Configuration Options page for more details.\n\n\n5. Setup your database\nAlso in the server chunk, setup your database with the sd_database() function. You can also leave it blank to preview / edit your survey without database connected, or set pause = TRUE to disconnect the survey. See the Database Settings page for more details.\n\n\n6. Locally preview\nPreview your survey by clicking the “Run Document” button in RStudio or in your terminal running the command:\n\nquarto serve survey_file_name.qmd\n\nReplacing survey_file_name.qmd with the name of your survey .qmd file.\n\n\n7. Deploy\nDeploy your survey by hosting it on your favorite server, like shinyapps.io, huggingface, etc. See the Deployment page for more details.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Step 1-2: Set your password\nOne important setting is the password of your supabase project. Here’s how.\nWhile you set up your supabase project, you will create a password for it. This password will then be defined in your survey project. In the very end of your survey .qmd file, you’ll need to define the db variable, which should be the settings of your supabase project. There is an argument called password. You can directly paste your password here as password = \"my_password\", but it’s not recommended since this will make your supabase project unsafe.\nWe recommend you to write password = Sys.getenv(\"SUPABASE_PASSWORD\"), like this:\n\ndb &lt;- sd_database(\n  # Other settings...\n  password = Sys.getenv(\"SUPABASE_PASSWORD\")\n)\n\nThen, define the password using the sd_set_password() function. For example, if your password is my_password, you should run sd_set_password(\"my_password\") in the R Console.\nGreat! Now you have your supabase password successfully defined in your survey project!\nIf you are interested, below are the details of what sd_set_password() does:\n\nIt creates an .Renviron file or writes into an existing one.\nIn this .Renviron file, it writes in SUPABASE_PASSWORD=my_password, where \"my_password\" is whatever your argument of the sd_set_password() function.\nIf there is a previously defined SUPABASE_PASSWORD in .Renviron, it will be overwritten, so you are safe to run this function multiple times.\nIt adds .Renviron into .gitignore to avoid it being pushed to GitHub thus keeps your password safe. If you run multiple times, .Renviron will appear only once in .gitignore.",
